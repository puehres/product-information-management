- [ ] ❌ REJECTED - Major issues require revision

### Issues Identified
```markdown
No critical issues identified. The PRP is well-structured and comprehensive.
```

### Recommendations
```markdown
1. Excellent identification of root cause - incorrect boto3 pattern vs permissions issue
2. Comprehensive context provided including working AWS Console URL example
3. Clear validation strategy with existing test invoice file
4. Proper preservation of existing functionality and security measures
5. Well-defined success criteria with measurable outcomes
```

## Detailed Review Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Clear Problem Identification**: Correctly identifies the issue as incorrect boto3 presigned URL generation pattern, not AWS permissions
2. **Comprehensive Context**: Includes working AWS Console URL example, existing test files, and detailed analysis
3. **Minimal Scope**: Focused fix to single method without unnecessary changes
4. **Validation Strategy**: Uses existing test invoice file for real-world validation
5. **Security Preservation**: Maintains URL expiration and all existing security measures
6. **Documentation**: Extensive references to AWS documentation and best practices

### Technical Accuracy
1. **Boto3 Pattern**: Correctly identifies the fix - using `ClientMethod='get_object'` instead of positional parameter
2. **Parameter Removal**: Correctly identifies that `ResponseContentDisposition` may cause signature issues
3. **Error Handling**: Preserves existing error handling and logging patterns
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test strategy including unit, integration, and regression tests

### Implementation Feasibility
1. **Single Method Fix**: Minimal scope reduces risk of introducing new issues
2. **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverages existing S3 client configuration and error handling
3. **Validation Tools**: Clear validation commands and expected outcomes
4. **Rollback Safety**: Changes are isolated and easily reversible if needed

### Quality Assurance
1. **Test Coverage**: Includes unit tests, integration tests, and real-world validation
2. **Regression Prevention**: Validates existing S3 operations continue to work
3. **Security Validation**: Ensures URL expiration behavior remains intact
4. **Documentation**: Requires updates to analysis documents and code comments

## Approval Checklist
- [x] All critical issues resolved
- [x] Testing strategy is comprehensive
- [x] Documentation requirements are clear
- [x] Implementation plan is executable
- [x] Ready for PRP execution phase
