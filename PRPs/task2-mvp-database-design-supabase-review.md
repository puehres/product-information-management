- [ ] ❌ REJECTED - Major issues require revision

### Issues Identified
```markdown
No critical issues identified. The PRP is comprehensive and well-structured.
```

### Recommendations
```markdown
1. Consider adding specific performance monitoring queries to validate the < 100ms query performance target
2. Include specific examples of the JSONB scraping_config structure for Lawn Fawn
3. Add validation for Supabase free tier limits monitoring to prevent unexpected service interruptions
4. Consider documenting the specific Supabase CLI commands for type generation in the frontend integration section
```

## Detailed Review Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Context**: The PRP includes extensive documentation links and references that provide all necessary context for implementation
2. **Clear Task Structure**: The 12-task implementation plan is well-ordered and logical, following a proper dependency chain
3. **Robust Testing Strategy**: Includes unit, integration, performance, and error handling tests with specific execution commands
4. **Environment Configuration**: Thorough coverage of environment setup for both development and production
5. **Performance Considerations**: Clear benchmarks and optimization strategies included
6. **Security Awareness**: Proper handling of API keys, RLS setup, and security best practices
7. **Migration Strategy**: Well-defined approach for schema evolution and backup procedures
8. **Type Safety**: Strong emphasis on TypeScript integration and type generation

### Technical Validation
1. **Supabase Integration**: Correctly uses service keys for backend and anon keys for frontend
2. **Schema Design**: The 4-table MVP approach is appropriate for the stated goals
3. **Performance Indexes**: Comprehensive indexing strategy for query optimization
4. **Error Handling**: Proper async/await patterns and error handling throughout
5. **Validation Commands**: All validation loops include executable commands with expected outputs

### Implementation Feasibility
1. **Task Dependencies**: Each task builds logically on previous tasks
2. **Technology Stack**: Aligns perfectly with existing backend (Python/FastAPI) and frontend (TypeScript/Next.js) setup
