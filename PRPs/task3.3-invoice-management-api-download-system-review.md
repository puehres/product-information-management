```

## Detailed Review Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Context**: The PRP includes extensive context from existing codebase patterns, making it highly actionable
2. **Clear Implementation Path**: Tasks are well-ordered and include specific code examples
3. **Robust Testing Strategy**: Covers unit tests, integration tests, and manual validation
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling patterns following existing codebase conventions
5. **Performance Considerations**: Includes database indexes and pagination optimization
6. **Security Awareness**: Addresses input validation and SQL injection prevention

### Technical Validation
1. **Database Patterns**: Correctly uses existing Supabase client patterns
2. **API Design**: Follows FastAPI best practices with proper Query validation
3. **Response Models**: Enhances existing models rather than creating conflicting ones
4. **Pagination Logic**: Implements proper pagination with total count calculation
5. **Search Implementation**: Uses case-insensitive search with proper escaping

### Implementation Feasibility
1. **Existing Infrastructure**: Builds on established database service patterns
2. **Test Data Available**: Uses existing Lawn Fawn invoice for validation
3. **Incremental Approach**: Can be implemented step-by-step with validation at each stage
4. **Rollback Safety**: Changes are additive and don't break existing functionality

### Documentation Quality

## Confidence Score: 9/10

This PRP scores highly for one-pass implementation success due to:
- Comprehensive context and examples from existing codebase
- Clear, executable implementation steps
- Robust validation and testing strategy
- Proper error handling and edge case consideration
- Integration with existing patterns rather than creating new ones

The only minor deduction is for the complexity of the search functionality, which may require some iteration to get the Supabase query syntax exactly right.
