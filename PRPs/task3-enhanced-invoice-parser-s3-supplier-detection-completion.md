### üß™ Testing Results

**Validation Tests Completed:**
- ‚úÖ **Import Validation**: All core services import successfully
- ‚úÖ **FastAPI Application**: App creates and routes register correctly
- ‚úÖ **Dependencies**: All required packages installed and working
- ‚úÖ **Configuration**: S3 and invoice settings properly configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **S3 Connectivity**: AWS credentials require validation (SignatureDoesNotMatch error)

**Routes Registered Successfully:**
```
/api/v1/upload/invoice - PDF upload endpoint
/api/v1/invoices/{batch_id}/download - Download endpoint  
/api/v1/invoices/{batch_id}/details - Details endpoint
/api/v1/invoices - List endpoint
/api/v1/health - Health check
```
