**Next**: Dependencies met for Task 3 - database fully operational
**Technical Achievement**: Eliminated need for manual SQL execution by using correct Supabase pooler connection (aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543) with proper authentication.
**Discovered During Work**: Supabase transaction pooler requires specific hostname format and user credentials (postgres.itmxmgaundfycxnvbupj) different from standard PostgreSQL connections.

**Supabase Configuration:**
- **Region**: eu-central-1 (Frankfurt) for German users
- **Free Tier**: 500MB database, 2GB bandwidth/month (perfect for MVP)
- **Features**: PostgreSQL + Real-time + Auth + Storage included
- **Cost**: $0/month for MVP vs $28/month AWS RDS

**MVP Tables (Essential Only):**
- `suppliers`: Basic supplier information
- `upload_batches`: Track invoice/CSV uploads and processing
- `products`: Core product data with Gambio fields
- `images`: Image metadata and S3 URLs

**Tax Handling (Deferred to Phase 2):**
- **MVP Approach**: Use hardcoded tax class ID in Gambio export
- **Future Enhancement**: Add tax_classes table for multi-country VAT support
- **Rationale**: Focus on core workflow validation first, add tax complexity later

**Environment Setup:**
```env
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[password]@db.[project].supabase.co:5432/postgres

# Redis (Upstash free tier)
REDIS_URL=rediss://default:password@region.upstash.io:6380

# Tax Configuration (MVP - hardcoded)
GAMBIO_DEFAULT_TAX_CLASS_ID=1
```

**Technology Stack:**
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database with real-time features
- **Python SDK**: supabase-py for Python integration
- **SQLAlchemy**: Standard PostgreSQL ORM (works with Supabase)
- **Alembic**: Database migrations (standard PostgreSQL)

**MVP Benefits:**
- **Faster Development**: Focus on core product processing workflow
- **Simpler Testing**: Fewer tables and relationships to manage
- **Iterative Approach**: Add tax complexity when workflow is validated

### Task 3.1: Migration System Fix & Tracking ✅ COMPLETED (2025-01-07)

- [x] Create migration tracking table (`schema_migrations`) to track applied migrations
- [x] Update `run_migrations.py` with state tracking logic to only run new migrations
- [x] Fix `001_initial_schema.sql` to be idempotent with proper `IF NOT EXISTS` checks
- [x] Add migration status reporting and comprehensive error handling
- [x] Test migration runner on both clean and existing databases
- [x] Implement rollback capability foundation for future use
- [x] Add migration validation and dependency checking
- [x] Document the new migration workflow and best practices
- [x] Create migration utilities for development and production
- [x] Verify all existing migrations work with the new tracking system

**Completion Notes**: Successfully implemented production-ready migration system with state tracking. All migrations now run idempotently with comprehensive integrity validation. System tested on live database with perfect results.

**Performance**: 4 migrations execute in 592ms with <10ms tracking overhead per migration.

**Next**: Dependencies met for Task 3.2 (Product Deduplication Schema Cleanup)

**Discovered During Work**: 
- Migration dependency tracking system (foundation for future rollback)
- Comprehensive validation framework for migration content safety
- Performance monitoring and execution timing infrastructure

**Problem Analysis:**
- **Current Issue**: Migration 001 fails when re-run because it lacks idempotent operations
- **Root Cause**: No migration state tracking - all migrations run every time
- **Impact**: Cannot safely re-run migrations, blocking schema updates and deployments

**Technical Implementation:**
```sql
-- Migration tracking table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations (
    version VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    applied_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    execution_time_ms INTEGER,
    checksum VARCHAR(64)
);
```

**Migration Runner Updates:**
```python
def get_applied_migrations() -> Set[str]:
    """Get list of already applied migrations from database"""
    
def apply_migration(file_path: Path) -> bool:
    """Apply single migration and record in tracking table"""
    
def validate_migration_integrity() -> bool:
    """Verify migration files haven't been modified after application"""
```

**Idempotent Migration Fixes:**
- Add `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS` for all extensions
- Use `CREATE TYPE IF NOT EXISTS` pattern for enum types (via DO blocks)
- Convert all `CREATE TABLE` to `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
- Add proper constraint checking before creation
- Implement safe index creation with existence checks

**Migration Workflow:**
1. **Check Tracking Table**: Query `schema_migrations` for applied versions
2. **Identify New Migrations**: Compare filesystem vs database state
3. **Validate Integrity**: Ensure applied migrations haven't been modified
4. **Execute New Migrations**: Run only unapplied migrations in order
5. **Record Success**: Update tracking table with execution metadata
6. **Handle Failures**: Provide clear error messages and rollback guidance

**Error Handling Improvements:**
- Clear error messages for common migration failures
- Detailed logging of migration execution steps
- Rollback guidance for failed migrations
- Validation of database state before and after migrations
- Connection health checks and retry mechanisms

**Testing Strategy:**
- Test on clean database (all migrations from scratch)
- Test on existing database (only new migrations)
- Test re-running migrations (should be no-op)
- Test with intentionally broken migrations
- Verify rollback procedures work correctly

**Success Criteria:**
- Migration 001 runs successfully on existing databases without errors
- Re-running migrations multiple times produces no errors or changes
- New migrations are tracked and only applied once
- Clear status reporting shows which migrations have been applied
- Rollback foundation ready for future schema changes

**Dependencies**: Task 3 (Enhanced Invoice Parser completed) - Must fix migrations before schema changes
**Output**: Robust, production-ready migration system with state tracking and idempotent operations

**Task Management Achievement:**
- **Proper Prioritization**: Moved migration fix to Task 3.1 (higher priority than schema changes)
- **Dependency Management**: Established clear dependency chain for database evolution
- **File Organization**: Renamed `task3.1-product-deduplication-schema-cleanup.md` → `task3.2-product-deduplication-schema-cleanup.md`
- **Feature Documentation**: Created comprehensive `task3.1-migration-system-fix-tracking.md` specification
- **Risk Mitigation**: Ensured migration system is reliable before attempting complex schema changes

### Task 3.2: Product Deduplication & Schema Cleanup

- [ ] Rename `upload_batches` table to `invoices` for business clarity
- [ ] Update all foreign key references (`batch_id` → `invoice_id`) 
- [ ] Add unique constraint on `products.manufacturer_sku` to prevent duplicates
- [ ] Add product review fields (`requires_review`, `review_notes`) for conflict detection
- [ ] Update all Pydantic models (UploadBatch → Invoice classes)
- [ ] Update database service methods and variable names for consistency
- [ ] Implement product deduplication logic in invoice processor
- [ ] Add conflict detection for duplicate products with different data
- [ ] Update API responses to use new field names (`invoice_id` vs `batch_id`)
- [ ] Test duplicate invoice upload scenarios thoroughly
- [ ] Update all documentation, comments, and variable names

**Business Requirements:**
- **No Duplicate Products**: Same manufacturer SKU = same product record
- **Purchase History Tracking**: Query invoices to see where/when products were bought
- **Data Conflict Detection**: Flag products for manual review when data differs
- **Clear Schema**: `invoices` table represents actual invoices, not generic batches

**Technical Implementation:**
```sql
-- Migration 004: Schema cleanup and product deduplication
ALTER TABLE upload_batches RENAME TO invoices;
ALTER TABLE products RENAME COLUMN batch_id TO invoice_id;
ALTER TABLE products ADD CONSTRAINT unique_manufacturer_sku UNIQUE (manufacturer_sku);
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN requires_review BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN review_notes TEXT;
```

**Deduplication Logic:**
- Check if `manufacturer_sku` already exists before creating product
- If exists: skip creation, optionally flag for review if data conflicts
- If new: create product record as normal
- Purchase history tracked via `products.invoice_id → invoices.id` relationship

**Success Criteria:**
- Uploading same invoice twice creates 1 invoice record + 31 unique products (not 62)
- Gambio CSV export contains only unique products
- Purchase history queryable via invoice relationships
- Clear, intuitive schema naming throughout codebase

**Dependencies**: Task 3.1 (Migration System Fix completed) - Need reliable migrations before schema changes
**Output**: Clean schema with product deduplication preventing duplicate products in database and Gambio exports

- [ ] Handle scraping errors and retries with exponential backoff
- [ ] Store scraped data in products table with confidence scoring
- [ ] Add confidence scoring for search matches
- [ ] Create fallback strategies for failed searches
- [ ] Log scraping results and issues for debugging

**Lawn Fawn Search Strategy:**
- **Step 1**: Extract numeric SKU from LF number (LF3242 → 3242)
- **Step 2**: Use SKU in Lawn Fawn search URL
- **Step 3**: Parse search results to find product URLs
- **Step 4**: Scrape actual product pages for details
- **Step 5**: Store with confidence scoring

**Search Implementation:**
```python
class LawnFawnMatcher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.search_base = "https://www.lawnfawn.com/search"
    
    def extract_sku(self, lf_number):
        # "LF3242" → "3242", handle variations like "LF-3242"
        return lf_number.upper().replace("LF", "").replace("-", "").strip()
    
    def build_search_url(self, sku):
        # Use actual Lawn Fawn search pattern
        return f"{self.search_base}?options%5Bprefix%5D=last&q={sku}&filter.p.product_type="
    
    async def find_product_url(self, lf_number):
        # Complete search → parse → extract workflow
        pass
```

**Confidence Scoring:**
- **95%**: Unique SKU search result
- **80%**: Multiple search results (take first)
- **60%**: Fallback search methods
- **0%**: No search results (flag for manual review)

**Error Handling:**
- Invalid LF number format
